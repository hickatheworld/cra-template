# cra-template-hicka
This is my CRA template. Getting rid of this test shits that I don't use *yet*, getting rid of this 2-spaces-indentation bullcrap.  
No CSS directory is needed, I usually style with either Emotion or Tailwind.

## Use
```
yarn create react-app app --template cra-template-hicka
```
